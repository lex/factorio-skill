  Factorio 2.1 + Space Age reference for modding and game mechanics. Use when
  writing control.lua, scenarios, map/surface generation, prototypes or
  data.raw, or mods (Factorio runtime API, LuaSurface, LuaEntity, events), and
  when reasoning about game mechanics — recipes, ratios, entity stats,
  terminology, limits, quirks, quality, spoilage, planets. Also use when
  porting a mod or scenario from 2.0 to 2.1, or when code fails on 2.1 with
  "is read only" or "doesn't contain key" errors. Targets Factorio 2.x (2.1
  stable) and the Space Age expansion.

# Factorio (2.x + Space Age)

> Version: Factorio **2.1** (stable since October 2026; 2.1.23 at the last
> update) with the **Space Age** expansion. Most references were written for
> **2.0** and still hold; `references/factorio-2.1.md` lists everything 2.1
> changed: removed and renamed API, data-stage changes, new numbers. Servers
> and mods may still run 2.0.77: check the version
> (`script.active_mods.base`) before giving version-specific advice. Facts
> predating 2.0 are out of scope unless explicitly labeled historical.

## What you get here

Curated essentials below (terminology + the highest-value gotchas); deeper
detail lives in `references/`. When a fact isn't covered here or in
`references/`, WebFetch the right page via `references/url-map.md` — do not
answer Factorio 2.x / Space Age facts from memory.

## Core terminology

- **Prototype** — a data-stage definition (recipe, entity, item, technology,
  etc.) stored in `data.raw`; frozen once the data stage ends.
- **`data.raw`** — the global table holding every prototype, keyed first by
  type then by name: `data.raw["type"]["name"]`.
- **Entity** — a placed, live instance of an entity prototype on a surface;
  accessed at runtime as a `LuaEntity`.
- **Surface** — a `LuaSurface`: the map/planet/platform that entities and
  tiles live on, looked up via `game.surfaces`.
- **Chunk** — a fixed-size area of a surface; generation is checked with
  `is_chunk_generated`, and pollution accumulates/spreads per chunk.
- **Tick / UPS** — the simulation step; `game.speed = 1.0` means normal speed,
  60 UPS (updates/ticks per second).
- **`storage`** — the per-mod persistent Lua table, serialized into the save
  and restored on load; called `global` before Factorio 2.0. Can hold data
  and `LuaObject` references, but not functions.
- **Data stage vs. control stage** — the data stage (`data.lua` →
  `data-updates.lua` → `data-final-fixes.lua`) defines prototypes and its Lua
  state is discarded when it ends; the control stage (`control.lua`) is the
  persistent runtime with `game`, `script`, and `storage`.
- **`on_init` / `on_load` / `on_configuration_changed`** — the three
  lifecycle handlers; `storage` is read-only and `game` is unavailable inside
  `on_load()`.
- **Recipe** — a `type = "recipe"` prototype defining `ingredients`,
  `results`, and `energy_required`.
- **Assembler / crafting machine** — entities such as
  `AssemblingMachinePrototype`, built on the abstract `CraftingMachinePrototype`,
  that execute recipes.
- **Force** — the faction/ownership grouping (e.g. the player force) that
  entities belong to, via `game.forces`.
- **LuaObject validity** — handles like `LuaEntity`/`LuaPlayer`/`LuaSurface`
  can go stale; check `.valid` before using a stored reference.
- **Quality** — Space Age feature: 5 tiers (Normal/Uncommon/Rare/Epic/
  Legendary) whose bonus scaling follows *tier strength* (0/1/2/3/5), not
  ordinal position.
- **Spoilage** — Space Age feature: many items decay into a spoilage/spoil
  product on a fixed timer that keeps running everywhere (machines, belts,
  even an inserter's hand).
- **Planet** — a distinct surface with its own hazards/resources (Vulcanus,
  Fulgora, Gleba, Aquilo); a `LuaPlanet`'s surface isn't auto-generated —
  it must be created or associated explicitly.
- **Space platform** — a self-contained orbital factory anchored by a space
  platform hub, built via ghost/remote construction and moved by thrusters.

### Build-pattern vocabulary

- **Main bus** — placing multiple belts side by side each carrying one
  resource, with setups branching off; the opposite of spaghetti.
- **Spaghetti** — a community term for the disorganized look of many
  belts/entities placed without a consistent layout.
- **Sushi belt** — mixing many different item types on one transport belt
  to supply machines that need some or all of those items.
- **(Belt) balancer** — a belt setup that balances multiple belts to
  contain the same amount of resources, maximizing throughput.
- **Bottleneck / backpressure** — a bottleneck is a single point where
  resources are constrained (e.g. a slow belt segment slowing everything);
  backpressure is what a machine, belt segment, or inserter experiences
  when delivery stalls because its target is backed up.
- **Mall (hub)** — a location in a factory that produces many different
  item types the player needs, in relatively small amounts.
- **SPM / eSPM** — science (packs) per minute; eSPM is "effective" SPM, a
  measure of SPM that explicitly includes all the upgrades.
- **Megabase** — a community term for a significantly large base built
  over significant time/effort, typically considered a megabase once it
  can maintain around 1k SPM.

## Cross-cutting quirks (read before scripting)

- **`storage`, not `global`.** Factorio 2.0 renamed the persistent per-mod
  data table; port any `global.foo` snippet to `storage.foo`.
- **2.1 removed some 2.0 API.** `entity.active = x` and `entity.minable = x`
  are read-only (use `disabled_by_script` and `minable_flag`), `entity.fluidbox`
  is gone (`get_fluid`/`set_fluid`), `defines.inventory.furnace_*` and
  `assembling_machine_*` are now `crafter_*`, and quick bar slots take a page
  and a slot. Most replacements already exist in 2.0.77, so ported code can
  run on both. Full table in `references/factorio-2.1.md`.
- **Check `.valid` before touching a stored `LuaObject`.** A destroyed
  entity/player/surface leaves a stale handle that errors on access.
- **Don't do real work in `on_load()`.** `game` isn't available there and
  `storage` is read-only; only re-hook metatables/handlers on data already in
  `storage`, or risk desyncs and broken replays.
- **Plain Lua locals don't survive a save/load.** Only `storage` is
  serialized — put anything that must outlive a tick boundary there.
- **`math.random()` is deterministic and seeded from the map seed;
  `math.randomseed()` does nothing.** Use a separate `LuaRandomGenerator` for
  an independent random stream.
- **Prototypes are frozen after the data stage, and stage order matters.**
  `data.lua` → `data-updates.lua` → `data-final-fixes.lua` run as rounds
  across *all* mods; something defined late may miss other mods' logic that
  already ran (e.g. barrelling recipes).

See `references/quirks.md` for the full list, including mechanics and Space
Age quirks (quality-ingredient exact-tier matching, recycler material loss,
solar priority order, circuit signal overflow, and more).
